#Things to look into:

-   [Splinter](http://splinter.cobrateam.info/) is a `selenium` driver.

-   See [http://cilliano.com/blog/2011/02/07/django-bdd-with-lettuce-and-splinter/](http://cilliano.com/blog/2011/02/07/django-bdd-with-lettuce-and-splinter/)

-   See [salad](https://github.com/salad/salad) as well which contains helpers and scaffolding for lettuce and splinter.
