#Things to look into:

-   [Splinter](http://splinter.cobrateam.info/) is a `selenium` driver.

-   See [http://cilliano.com/blog/2011/02/07/django-bdd-with-lettuce-and-splinter/](http://cilliano.com/blog/2011/02/07/django-bdd-with-lettuce-and-splinter/)

-   See [salad](https://github.com/salad/salad) as well which contains helpers and scaffolding for lettuce and splinter.

-   [Presentation](http://blip.tv/djangocon/testing-with-lettuce-and-splinter-5571880) on BDD with lettuce and splinter, good questions from POV outside of Ruby/Cucumber.

-   See [should-splinter](https://github.com/rodrigomanhaes/should-splinter) giving `shoulda` methods to splinter.

-   See [this](https://github.com/delfick/flask-splinter) for a kludgey `flask` and `splinter` example.
